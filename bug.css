The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% - 10);` will likely fail because you're subtracting a unitless number from a percentage.  Another common mistake involves nested `calc()` expressions without proper parentheses, leading to incorrect calculations. For instance, `height: calc(calc(100% - 20px) - 10px);` is valid, but `height: calc(100% - 20px - 10px);` might not evaluate correctly depending on the browser.
